# WADDLE CHAT
A simple web-app Chat Application I wrote in Go and HTML, I'll keep updating it, hope you enjoy ;)
# How to run the executables
To run the executables, you just need to download ChatApplication.exe in the Executables folder and double-click on it. If it doesn't open (which happens a lot of times) just open the cmd and run it by typing ChatApplication.exe (remember to move to the right folder!).
