# How to run the executables
Extract the .zip in the Beta 0.1 or Beta 0.2 folder and open the main  .exe file inside the zip by double-clicking on it or with the cmd (to have more control and also the function to change the port of the address type Waddle-Chat-0.1.exe or Waddle-Chat-0.2.exe -addr=":4097" in the command prompt, of course the number can be whatever you want).<br>
Then open your browser and type localhost:8080 (or the number you chose with the cmd) and you will be able to chat, if you have more PCs connected with the same IP, DNS and, obviously, Network, you can chat between them! It's fun, isn'it?<br>
To stop it just close the cmd ;)
# How to run the code
I'll upload the code soon, for now enjoy the executables and tell me what you think, remember that it's still the BETA!
# Next versions
The next versions will come about every week with bug fixes and new functions.<br>
<strong>Beta 0.2</strong><br>
In this version I uploaded the graphics, currently working on user accounts and having some trouble implementing them. (If you know Golang contact me thanks).<br>
