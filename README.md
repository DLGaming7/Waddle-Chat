# How to run the executables
To run the executables, you just need to download nameofthefile.exe in the Executables folder and double-click on it. If it doesn't open (which happens a lot of times) just open the cmd and run it by typing nameofthefile.exe (remember to move to the right folder!).
An interesting function I implemented is to type on the cmd when running it: nameofthefile.exe -addr="4008"
This will change the port of localhost to localhost:4008 (open it on your browser and...Ta-dan it suddenly works, here you have Waddle-Chat!).
